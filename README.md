# first-steps
This is my first repository to get familiar with Github.

All infromation are taken from https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/.

<br/>

### 1st step: Create a repository

A repository is used to create a project. It can contain anything your project needs (folders, files, images, videos, spreadsheets, data sets). It is recommended to include a README, which is a file that contains information about your project.

To create a repository:
* In the upper right corner, next to your avatar, click _+_ and then select _New repository_
* Name your repository
* Write a short description
* Initialize your repository with a README
* Click _Create repository_ button
 
 <br/>
 
### 2nd step: Create a branch
Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time. By default your repository has one branch named `master` which is considered to be the final branch. When you create a branch off the master branch, you're making a copy of `master`. These branches are used to experiment and make edits before merging them to `master`.

To create a new branch:
* Go to your repository
* Click on the drop down that says _Branch: master_
* Type a branch name, `readme-edits`, into the new branch text box
* Click on box that says _Create branch: `readme-edits` from 'master'_

<br/>

### 3rd step: Make and commit changes
On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. They help other contributors to understand what you’ve done and why.

To make and commit changes:
* Click the `README.me` file
* Click the pencil icon in the upper right corner of the file view to edit
* In the editor (`<> Edit file`), make the changes
* In the `Commit` changes section below, write a commit message that describes your changes (short description and optional extended description)
* Click _Commit changes_ button

These changes will be made to the README file on your readme-edits branch, so now this branch contains content that’s different from your master branch.

<br/>

### 4th step: Open a pull request
Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. Opening a pull requests means proposing your changes and requesting someones review. Pull requests show differences of the content from the original branch (`master`) and edited branch (`readme-edits`). The changes are shown in green (additions) and red (subtractions). As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.

To open a pull request:
* Within your repository, click the _Pull requests_ tab and then the _New pull request_ button
* Select the branches you want to compare, e.g. base: `master` & compare: `readme-edits`
* Look over your changes on the Compare page and make sure they're what you want to submit
* Click _Create pull request_ button
* Give your pull request a title and write a brief description of your changes
* Click _Create pull request_ button

<br/>

### 5th step: Merge a pull request
In this step, you want to bring changes and the original branch together, i.e., merging your `readme-edits` branch into your `master`branch.

To merge a pull request:
* Click the green _Merge pull request_ button to merge the changes into `master`
* Click _Confirm merge_
* Since its changes have been incorporated, delete the branch with the _Delete branch_ button in the purple box

<br/>

Now you are done!
